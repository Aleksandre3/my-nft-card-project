- ## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Hover animation
- CSS Variables

### What I learned

I am happy to share with you my second project with HTML/CSS ðŸš€
I'm a beginner in HTML/CSS, I feel like I'll get better at writing styles in css with practice.
I have a good understanding of how CSS Flexbox works. Also how colors, fonts, and other components
are stored in variables to make our code look more organized. of course this is just the beginning.
My goal is to thoroughly study responsive design to make the project more flexible and adaptable to all devices.

There are big challenges ahead!!! ðŸš€ âœŠ
